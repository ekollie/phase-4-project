# user stories

As a user, I want to access my profile to view my personal information, review anonymous compliments I have received, and manage their visibility.

As a user, I want to view the anonymous compliments I have received and have the option to make them public by 'hearting' them, so that I can share positive feedback with others if I choose to.

As a user, I want to view other users' profiles to learn more about my colleagues and see any compliments they have chosen to make public.
Posting Anonymous Compliments to Others

As a user, I want to post anonymous compliments to my colleaguesâ€™ profiles,  with the understanding that these compliments are initially private to the recipient.

As a user, I want to like public compliments that others have made visible, to show my support and agreement with the positive feedback shared in the workplace.
